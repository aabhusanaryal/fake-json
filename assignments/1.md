# Lecture 1

### 1. Merge Sort
Use merge sort to sort the data in [mergesort-input.csv](https://github.com/IT-Club-Pulchowk/Advanced-C-Workshop-Samples/blob/main/Lecture-2/mergesort_input.csv) per line and output sorted array perline to **“mergesort-output.csv”**.

### 2. Hash Table
Implement an **open chained** hashmap with **adler32** as hash function to solve the following problem.
In [airport_a.txt](https://github.com/IT-Club-Pulchowk/Advanced-C-Workshop-Samples/blob/main/Lecture-2/airport_a.txt) you are given names of 15 airports. In [airport_b.csv](https://github.com/IT-Club-Pulchowk/Advanced-C-Workshop-Samples/blob/main/Lecture-2/airport_b.csv) you are given pairs of airports.
“Bhairahawa”,”Kathmandu” means a flight leaves Bhairahawa to Kathmandu. Calculate the city with **the highest number of incoming flights**, put it in **airport_output.csv** and follow it with a list of incoming airports. Each airport must be enclosed in double quotes and comma separated.


 Miniature example:

| From     |To |
|-----------|------------|
| Pokhara   | Kathmandu  |
| Pokhara   | Jiri       |
| Pokhara   | Jomsom     |
| Kathmandu | Pokhara    |
| Kathmandu | Jomsom     |


Jomsom has 2 incoming flight, which is the highest. Hence, airport_output.csv should be:
```2,”Pokhara”,”Kathmandu”```


### 3. Binary Tree

a. Given a list of **polynomial expressions** in [polynomial_derivative.txt](https://github.com/IT-Club-Pulchowk/Advanced-C-Workshop-Samples/blob/main/Lecture-2/polynomial_derivative.csv), calculate the **indefinite derivative** and sort the terms in ascending order of power. And write it to **polynomial_derivative_out.txt**.


**Input file:**

```
5x^2 + 3x^3 + 9x +5
6x^3+ 5x^5 + 3x^3
```


**Output file:**
```
9x^2+10x+9
25x^4 + 27x^2
```

b. Create an infix calculator. Input will be as expressions per line in “infix_input.txt”. Output results perline in infix_output.txt.

**Input file**
```
5*7 + 9/3 + 1/2
6-12*12+1/3
```

**Output file**
```
24.5
-133.666...
```
